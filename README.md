# 💸 Expense Splitter & Debt Tracker Web Application

A web-based expense management system built using **Java, Spring Boot (MVC), MySQL, HTML, and CSS** that helps users:

* Split group expenses based on custom percentages
* Track personal debts (who owes whom)
* Receive automated email reminders for pending payments

This project focuses on applying backend concepts like **MVC architecture, database relationships, business logic handling, and email automation** in a practical financial use case.

## 🚀 Features

  * Displays final split result

✔ Handles real-time calculation

✔ Ensures total percentage equals 100%

✔ Prevents invalid inputs


### 2️⃣ Debt Tracking Mode (Who Owes Whom)

* User can:

  * Track how much they owe someone
  * Track how much someone owes them
